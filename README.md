--BioChem_DESc-

'Biochemistry Description, Evaluation and Script compiler'

This is the Repo for BioChem_DESc app that we hope to develop into a PWA (progressive web-app).

Looking for collaborators in Biology, Chemistry, Programming and Statistics

-Credits
There will credit that needs to be given to the Open mySQL community, postgreSQL database and connectors, Python community for any module needed to complete the project (list of modules in requirements.txt), 'epam open source' for their chemistry database information and the RSC for anything required from the Protein Databank (PB); currently interested in small molecules

PyMol may also be involved but no promisses..(we pray for any excuse).


-About
The end-point objective is to create a method of entering a molecule forumla, SMILES code, PDB file or drawing and return a set of similar chemicals, split into 'Known/Available for purchase' and 'Theorectical'. 

Along with this should be any information on known protein interactions with the first of the afformentioned lists. Thats the 'Description'

The a method of evaluating gthe 'Theoretical' list of small molecules, well thats the 'Evaluation'

Finally, because of the huge amount of information that would need to be included with any such single query, an easy to query database will be required for the end-user. Thats why it is a PWA, all this in a web-browser.
..hence 'Script compiler'. We will make a mini-downloadable-custom-database!

-Requirements

There is an installation folder with most of the software you will need or a list of additional programs (such as Python modules)


-Contact and legal
please give a follow and/or get in contact through GitHub: 'X-into-Y-Ali'

You can also email me at alistair.moir.xintoy@protonmail.com

While X-into-Y is to begin trading as XINTOY LTD, we hope to put this online for free and everyone to use.

Excluding 'Contact and Legal', this readme is likely to change..
